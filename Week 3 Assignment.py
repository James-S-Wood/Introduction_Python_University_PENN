def concatenate(strings):
    """
    Concatenates the given list of strings into a single string.
    Returns the single string.

    For example:
    - If we call concatenate(["a","b","c"]), we'll get "abc" in return
    - If we call concatenate([]), we'll get "" in return

    Hint(s):
    - Remember, you can create a single string from a list of multiple strings by using the join() function

    - If we call remove_duplicates([]), we'll get [] in return

    Hint(s):

    Hint(s):
    - You can iterate over a word in reverse and access each character

    - If we call capitalize_or_join_words("i love    python  "), we'll get "i,love,python" in return.

    Hint(s):
    - The startswith() function checks whether a string starts with a particualr character
    - The capitalize() function capitalizes the first letter of a string
    - The upper() function converts all lowercase characters in a string to uppercase
